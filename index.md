## Political Economy Seminar Series in Zurich 

The seminar series brings together researchers in political economy that are or have been affiliated with
Zurich's universities.  
We hope to provide an opportunity for current and former postdocs, young faculty, and PhD candidates at the University of Zurich or ETH Zurich to present their current work and receive extensive and critical feedback. 
The semianr series focuses on empirical paper in political economy (this could be more precise--where do we draw the line?). 

The seminar series is currently hosted by Judith Spirig (UCL,
Department of Political Science), Achim Ahrens (ETH, Public Policy Group), Daniel Bischof (UZH, Department of Political Science) and Moritz Marbach (ETH, Public Policy Group). 

The fall 2020 version of the seminar series will take place online, weekly via Zoom on Tuesdays from 5-6 PM (UTC+2).
