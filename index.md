# Political Economy Seminar Series in Zurich 

The seminar series is an opportunity for current and former postdocs, young faculty, and Ph.D. candidates at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich to present an empirical paper they are working on and receive extensive and critical feedback from their peer group.

Department of Political Science), Achim Ahrens (ETH, Public Policy Group), Daniel Bischof (UZH, Department of Political Science) and Moritz Marbach (ETH, Public Policy Group).
